<description><![CDATA[<p>Date: November 9, 2024</p><p><p>Join us for a free, year-round &#8220;Fitness at the Fort&#8221; exercise program on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays!</p><p>This fitness class incorporates climbing multiple staircases, stretches and strengthening exercises, notable tree identification, and forest bathing. Led by instructor, Nancy Bruning, BA, MPH, PAPHS.</p><p>Classes are structured so that all levels of fitness will be accommodated; however, all classes involve relatively brisk walking and some stairs because of the layout of the park itself. Classes vary according to the season, path conditions, and the weather, but always meet at the Heather Garden entrance.</p><p>Tuesday and Thursday classes end at various points near the starting point, including the volleyball courts. Saturday class ends at the Anne Loftus Playground, using the various pieces of equipment, and offers optional after-class group walk to the Greenmarket on Isham Street. All classes end with closing with stretches.</p><p>(Note: Fitness Walking does not meet if it is raining or if the actual temperature or wind chill is below 20 degrees F.)</p></p><p>Start time: 8:30 am</p><p>End time: 9:30 am</p><p>Contact phone: </p><p>Location: Margaret Corbin Circle (in Fort Tryon Park)</p>]]></description>

The program is free and open to runners and walkers of all ages, abilities, and experience levels.</p><p>Evidence of Inwood Hill Park&#8217;s formation exists as caves, valleys, and ridges left as the result of shifting glaciers. Evidence of its uninhabited state afterward remains as its forest and salt marsh (the last natural one in Manhattan), and evidence of its use by Native Americans continues to be discovered. Most of the park was largely untouched by wars and development. The park features a hiking trail and the Hudson River Bike Trail, and is one of the best places in NYC to spot a bald eagle. It also includes athletic fields, playgrounds, dog runs, and a barbecue area.</p><p>The course is three loops on hilly trails and walkways through woods and along a salt marsh.</p></p><p>Start time: 8:45 am</p><p>End time: 10:30 am</p><p>Contact phone: </p><p>Location: Seaman Avenue and Isham Street Entrance (in Inwood Hill Park)</p>]]></description>

Every two weeks, dancers will visit a new dance style while building off the techniques and skills learned in previous weeks. The first two weeks will focus on Ballet.

Dancers will learn the foundational techniques of these styles while learning to embed emotional expression into choreography. The final two weeks will focus on commercial dance styles such as Hip Hop, Musical Theater, and Commercial Jazz. These styles will encourage dancers to use their technique, emotion, and imagination to emulate the choreography they see in TV, movies, and professional performances. Dance games and short choreography combinations will help dancers memorize techniques and stylistic niches while developing a holistic understanding of the art of dance.<br/><br/></p><p>Start time: 12:00 pm</p><p>End time: 1:00 pm</p><p>Contact phone: </p><p>Location: Dance Room (in Marcus Garvey Park)</p>]]></description>

Surrounded by lush acreage of forests, marshland and meadows, the Conference House overlooks the Arthur Kill River, Lower Raritan Bay and nearby New Jersey.

<description><![CDATA[<p>Date: November 12, 2024</p><p>Connect with yourself in Slow Flow Yoga, a class to be enjoyed by all. For those who want to move but at a slower more therapeutic pace. Slow flow yoga connects movement with breath, emphasizing mindful engagement, awareness, and ease through each pose. As most postures are typically held longer than in more energetic forms of yoga, students have the time and space to move deliberately, explore subtler levels of alignment and deepen the stretch as they connect-in with their body. Recommended props for the class include: three large pillows (or as many as you need), two blankets, two blocks (or books to act as blocks), one eye pillow (or towel to cover eyes). <br/><br/>The Zoom link will be sent out three hours before the class and again right before the class starts to registered participants.</p><p>Start time: 6:00 pm</p><p>End time: 7:15 pm</p><p>Contact phone: </p><p>Location: Virtual/Online Events</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Date: November 16, 2024</p><p><p>NYRR Open Run Brings free, 5K weekly community-led runs, to neighborhood parks across the greater New York City area. The program is free and open to runners and walkers of all ages, abilities, and experience levels.</p><p>Evidence of Inwood Hill Park&#8217;s formation exists as caves, valleys, and ridges left as the result of shifting glaciers. Evidence of its uninhabited state afterward remains as its forest and salt marsh (the last natural one in Manhattan), and evidence of its use by Native Americans continues to be discovered. Most of the park was largely untouched by wars and development. The park features a hiking trail and the Hudson River Bike Trail, and is one of the best places in NYC to spot a bald eagle. It also includes athletic fields, playgrounds, dog runs, and a barbecue area.</p><p>The course is three loops on hilly trails and walkways through woods and along a salt marsh.</p></p><p>Start time: 8:45 am</p><p>End time: 10:30 am</p><p>Contact phone: </p><p>Location: Seaman Avenue and Isham Street Entrance (in Inwood Hill Park)</p>]]></description>

An invaluable relic in America&#8217;s history, the Conference House was the site of a 1776 peace conference which attempted to end the Revolutionary War.  Edward Rutledge, John Adams, Lord Howe and Benjamin Franklin were among those in attendance.  Surrounded by lush acreage of forests, marshland and meadows, the Conference House overlooks the Arthur Kill River, Lower Raritan Bay and nearby New Jersey.  The history and location of our museum gives visitors a glimpse of a pre populated landscape of New York City, while also illustrating our nation&#8217;s history.</p><p> </p><p>Come visit us!</p></p><p>Start time: 12:00 pm</p><p>End time: 4:00 pm</p><p>Contact phone: (718) 984-6046</p><p>Location: Conference House Museum (in Conference House Park)</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Date: November 16, 2024</p><p>Free VOLO KIDS Dance program in Partnership with NYC Parks. Dancers will be guided through 6-weeks of introductory dance classes. Every two weeks, dancers will visit a new dance style while building off the techniques and skills learned in previous weeks. The first two weeks will focus on Ballet. Dancers will learn the basics of ballet and implement them in other complex movements. The next two weeks will consist of Jazz and Contemporary styles using the ballet foundation. Dancers will learn the foundational techniques of these styles while learning to embed emotional expression into choreography. The final two weeks will focus on commercial dance styles such as Hip Hop, Musical Theater, and Commercial Jazz. These styles will encourage dancers to use their technique, emotion, and imagination to emulate the choreography they see in TV, movies, and professional performances. Dance games and short choreography combinations will help dancers memorize techniques and stylistic niches while developing a holistic understanding of the art of dance.<br/><br/></p><p>Start time: 12:00 pm</p><p>End time: 1:00 pm</p><p>Contact phone: </p><p>Location: Dance Room (in Marcus Garvey Park)</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Date: November 16, 2024</p><p>Free VOLO KIDS Dance program in Partnership with NYC Parks. Dancers will be guided through 6-weeks of introductory dance classes. Every two weeks, dancers will visit a new dance style while building off the techniques and skills learned in previous weeks. The first two weeks will focus on Ballet. Dancers will learn the basics of ballet and implement them in other complex movements. The next two weeks will consist of Jazz and Contemporary styles using the ballet foundation. Dancers will learn the foundational techniques of these styles while learning to embed emotional expression into choreography. The final two weeks will focus on commercial dance styles such as Hip Hop, Musical Theater, and Commercial Jazz. These styles will encourage dancers to use their technique, emotion, and imagination to emulate the choreography they see in TV, movies, and professional performances. Dance games and short choreography combinations will help dancers memorize techniques and stylistic niches while developing a holistic understanding of the art of dance.<br/><br/></p><p>Start time: 1:00 pm</p><p>End time: 2:00 pm</p><p>Contact phone: </p><p>Location: Dance Room (in Marcus Garvey Park)</p>]]></description>

An invaluable relic in America&#8217;s history, the Conference House was the site of a 1776 peace conference which attempted to end the Revolutionary War.  Edward Rutledge, John Adams, Lord Howe and Benjamin Franklin were among those in attendance.  Surrounded by lush acreage of forests, marshland and meadows, the Conference House overlooks the Arthur Kill River, Lower Raritan Bay and nearby New Jersey.  The history and location of our museum gives visitors a glimpse of a pre populated landscape of New York City, while also illustrating our nation&#8217;s history.</p><p> </p><p>Come visit us!</p></p><p>Start time: 12:00 pm</p><p>End time: 4:00 pm</p><p>Contact phone: (718) 984-6046</p><p>Location: Conference House Museum (in Conference House Park)</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Date: November 23, 2024</p><p><p>Join us for a free, year-round &#8220;Fitness at the Fort&#8221; exercise program on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays!</p><p>This fitness class incorporates climbing multiple staircases, stretches and strengthening exercises, notable tree identification, and forest bathing. Led by instructor, Nancy Bruning, BA, MPH, PAPHS.</p><p>Classes are structured so that all levels of fitness will be accommodated; however, all classes involve relatively brisk walking and some stairs because of the layout of the park itself. Classes vary according to the season, path conditions, and the weather, but always meet at the Heather Garden entrance.</p><p>Tuesday and Thursday classes end at various points near the starting point, including the volleyball courts. Saturday class ends at the Anne Loftus Playground, using the various pieces of equipment, and offers optional after-class group walk to the Greenmarket on Isham Street. All classes end with closing with stretches.</p><p>(Note: Fitness Walking does not meet if it is raining or if the actual temperature or wind chill is below 20 degrees F.)</p></p><p>Start time: 8:30 am</p><p>End time: 9:30 am</p><p>Contact phone: </p><p>Location: Margaret Corbin Circle (in Fort Tryon Park)</p>]]></description>

Surrounded by lush acreage of forests, marshland and meadows, the Conference House overlooks the Arthur Kill River, Lower Raritan Bay and nearby New Jersey.
